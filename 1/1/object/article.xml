      <title>Digital successions</title>
      <p>A digital succession contains digital objects. A digital object in
  this context is a fixed finite collection of bits. A computer file is
  an example of a digital object. A file system directory (folder) can
  also be represented as a digital object by both

  <xref alt="2" rid="ref-cosmo_referencing_2020" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.
  Conceptually, each digital object in a digital succession is a new
  edition of a previous digital object. Each edition is assigned a
  number which determines its order. Although a digital succession
  expands, each digital object within the succession does not
  change.</p>
      <p>A digital succession is also digitally signed. In the simplest
  case, a single user signs using a digital key that is verified to be
  for that user. In this specification, the digital signature is made
  using a

  key</ext-link>

  When a digital succession is first created, it consists of only a
  digitally signed genesis record and no digital object editions. A
  <italic>Digital Succession Identifier</italic> is an intrinsic
  identifier

  of the genesis record.</p>
      <sec id="digital-successions-implemented-via-git">
        <title>Digital successions implemented via git</title>
        <p>In the git implementation, the genesis record is a signed initial
    git commit with an empty tree (and no parent). To expand the digital
    succession, additional git commits are made using the same signing
    key. The git tree of each commit is not a digital object in the
    succession. The git tree of a commit is a record of all the digital
    object editions in the succession. The top level directory consists
    of only subdirectories named as non-negative integers. Within each
    integer named subdirectory is either an entry named
    <monospace>object</monospace> or entries named as non-negative
    integers that are subdirectories. An entry named
    <monospace>object</monospace> is a digital object edition in the
    digital succession. This digital object can be a file (git blob) or
    a directory (git tree). For example, when a single file is added as
    edition 1, the full succession record is a directory with one path
    of <monospace>1/object</monospace> to a git blob which is edition
    1.</p>

    <sec id="multilevel-edition-numbering">
      <title>Multilevel edition numbering</title>
      <p>In the simplest edition numbering scenario, edition numbers are
  just positive integers. For more advanced usage, multilevel edition
  numbering may be used. Multilevel numbering is found in the numbering
  of chapters, sections, and subsections (e.g. chapter 2, section 2.4,
  subsection 2.4.3). as well as software release versions (e.g. software
  release 2.19.2).</p>
      <p>An edition number prefix, such as <monospace>1</monospace>, can
  specify either a digital object edition or the entire sequence of
  editions <monospace>1.1</monospace>, <monospace>1.2</monospace>,
  <monospace>1.3</monospace>, etc... An edition number specifies either
  a digital object edition or a sequence of subordinate edition numbers,
  but not both. Larger integers indicate newer editions that obsolete
  older editions with smaller integers. The DSI specification does not
  specify any semantic meaning to different number levels.</p>

    <sec id="textual-representation-of-a-digital-succession-identifier">
      <title>Textual representation of a Digital Succession
  Identifier</title>
      <p>The textual representation of a Digital Succession Identifier (DSI)
  contains a base identifier followed by an optional slash followed by
  an optional edition number (possibly multilevel). The optional edition
  number is represented as non-negative integers separated by
  periods.</p>
      <p>The base DSI is calculated from the git initial commit (genesis
  record) of a digital succession. Git-compatible software can calculate
  a 20 byte binary hash which identifies that digital succession. In
  most uses of git, this 20 byte binary hash is represented textually as
  a 40 digit hexadecimal number. In contrast, for a DSI, this 20 byte
  binary hash has a 27 character representation in standard base64url
  format (RFC
  4648)<xref alt="5" rid="ref-rfc4648" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting, that when a new digital succession (git initial
  commit) is created, a user can choose not to use it and instead
  immediately create a new one with a different base64url text
  representation. There is little cost in not using empty digital
  successions and recreating new genesis records (git initial commits)
  until an acceptable base64url identifier is found.</p>

      <sec id="use-of-the-term-edition">
        <title>Use of the term edition</title>
        <p>The term edition is used to refer to a digital object in a
    digital succession. Part of the motivation is to avoid confusion
    with the many uses of the term version. For instance, version can be
    used to refer to versions of a digital object that are not added as
    editions.</p>
        <p>This language is partly due to the initial application of digital
    successions for scientific articles. Although there are rarely new
    versions of scientific articles after they are published, it is well
    established that scientific textbooks are published in multiple
    <italic>editions</italic>.</p>
        <p>In the initial application of digital successions, documents are
    the digital object. A single edition of a document might be
    presented in different HTML and PDF <italic>versions</italic>, even
    though they are the same <italic>edition</italic> of a document.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="separation-of-git-history-from-edition-history">
        <title>Separation of git history from edition history</title>
        <p>A significant design choice is to not directly rely on git commit
    history to determine the succession of editions. Git commit history
    is conducive to accurately and faithfully recording the actions
    performed with git. However this often can be inflexible and
    confusing for establishing a clean linear history. That Software
    Heritage automatically preserves git commits compounds the risk that
    git commits do not correspond well, or perhaps even prevent, an
    intended clean linear history. It seems likely that there will be
    situations where having merge commits and non-linear git commit
    history will be convenient.</p>
        <p>Having edition history separate from git history also provides a
    potential path for an enhancement akin to retractions of specific
    editions.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="use-of-git-tree-paths-instead-of-git-tags">
        <title>Use of git tree paths instead of git tags</title>
        <p>Edition numbers are similar to release versions of software
    projects. The usual practice in software development is to use git
    tags to identify releases. In contrast, this specification takes an
    different approach. Edition numbers are recorded with file paths in
    git trees rather than git tags.</p>
        <p>The main reason for this different approach has to do with how
    digital successions are recorded and copied. A highly desirable
    feature for digital successions is the ease of copying without
    errors. In particular, it is convenient to copy digital successions
    from multiple sources and store them in a single git repository. In
    this specification, a complete digital succession is captured by
    just a chain of commits (initial commit to latest commit). In
    contrast, entire software projects, which often include release
    tags, are usually copied by cloning an entire repository. If edition
    numbers were recorded as git annotated tags, copying digital
    successions properly would be a more complicated and error prone
    (due to missing tags).</p>
        <p>Git repository branches are a convenient tool for managing
    digital successions. But branch names are not part of the digital
    succession record.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="use-of-base64url-rather-than-hexadecimal">
        <title>Use of base64url rather than hexadecimal</title>
        <p>The textual identifier is in base64url (Base64 with URL and
    filename safe alphabet) as specified in RFC 4648
    <xref alt="5" rid="ref-rfc4648" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Both this
    format and hexadecimal have pros and cons.</p>
        <p>As mentioned in the introduction to the textual representation,
    there is no obligation to use the Digital Succession Identifier
    (DSI) generated by a brand new digital succession. If a DSI is
    unacceptable to the creator of a new digital succession, a new DSI
    can be easily generated. Helper tools could perform this function
    for users by default.</p>
        <p>The main con to base64url is that it can contain characters which
    are more prone to copy errors when transmitted via human sight.
    Certain fonts and handwriting can make poor or no distinction
    between certain character pairs. For example, some popular sans
    serif fonts make no visual distinction between capital I and
    lowercase l.</p>
        <p>The main pro to base64url is that it is 27 characters rather than
    40. Given that DSIs are used in contexts similar to DOIs, it is
    likely more acceptable to adopters to use 27 characters which is
    very typical for a long DOI, rather than 40 characters. Displaying
    an ID of 27 characters rather than 40 characters also fits better on
    web pages rendered on mobile devices. 27 characters are less like to
    be hidden by showing ellipsis, horizontal scroll regions or shrunk
    into extremely small fonts.</p>
        <p>This design decision is partly made on the belief that the
    copy-via-human-sight issue is increasingly mitigated by a few
    technology trends:</p>

            <p>Computer system are relied upon more and more via more
        reliable copying mechanisms such as clicking on hyperlinks,
